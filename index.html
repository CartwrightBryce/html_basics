  <h2>Life</h2>
      <p id= bryce-info>I grew up in Ohio in a small town outside of Newark Ohio with my parents and one older brother. Growing up I went to Licking Valley High School, and eventually went on to attend Ohio University in Athens Ohio. There I Studied management and buisiness at Ohio University and graduated in the winter of 2018. During my time as a student, I met who is now wife, Tori, as she was attending Ohio State University. Following my graduation, I moved in with Tori in Columbus Ohio. We moved around the state together a few times, though ended up in our present location back here in Athens for Tori's medical career. <br> </p>

  <h4>Interests</h4>
      <p> In my personal time and life I enjoy music, exercising, cooking, and getting outdoors. I play guitar in my own band <em>Do Not Resuscitate</em> (provide links for) and in my spare time am often writing and recording music. I have also always had a passion for exercising, staying fit, and eating well which ties into my other point about getting outdoors. Whether its hiking, camping, boating, or just taking a walk I really enjoy just being outside. Luckily, we live in the perfrect place for this too, Athens Ohio. Not only is the community here on of a kind, but the landscape is incredible here.<br></p>
